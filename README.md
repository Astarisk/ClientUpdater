# ClientUpdater

This project is a simple client updater based upon manifest files. The utils folder contains a script I use to generate the manifest file, ManifestGenerator.py. The ManifestGenerator also requires you to set the sftp variables. This is so you can connect to your own sftp server, and have the files automatically uploaded to the server. You would need to point the filedir variable in in ManifestGenerator towards the folder that contains the files you wish to generate a manifest for. You can read the variables at the top of this file for more documentation.

The updater supports basic auth, and can be enabled and disabled in the Config.py file. For now I choose to keep this disabled.
The Config file also contains the variables for changing where the client is saved, where it downloads from, and all the other goodies. 

Due to neccesity, the ManifestGenerator supports special cases where you might need a handwritten xml file. I needed this mainly for OS and arch support when it comes to downloading libraries. It was far easier just to make these xml files by hand then try to get it autogenerated.

For now, when you hit the run button all that happens is a jar is invoked, printing out the solutions to a Project Euler problem. The output for this project can be found in the errorlog.txt in the client directory.

You can run the project by invoking python on the Updater.py. For this project, I just ran and created it entirely in the Pycharm IDE.
